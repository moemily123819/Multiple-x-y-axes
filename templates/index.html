          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Comparing life expectancies of Americans at opposite ends of the wealth spectrum, as The New York Times did in 2014,
            provides an extreme case that income and health are intertwined. But your income affects your health no matter how 
            much money you make, said Laudan Aron of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.</p>

          <p>Aron is a coauthor of a report from the Urban Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University that traces some of 
            the links between income and health that contribute to the "longevity gap."

            "Wherever you are [in terms of income], people much better off than you are going to be healthier and live longer, 
            and people that are less well off financially are probably, as a group, on average, not going to live as long and be 
            less healthy," Aron told Business Insider.</p>

          <p>As family income increases, the number of years an adult can expect to live increases as well. If your family income 
            is two times the Federal Poverty Level, you get on average two more years of life than someone whose family income is
            less than the Federal Poverty Level, and on up the scale. It seems money can buy you more time alive.</p>
